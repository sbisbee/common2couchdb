common2couchdb
==============

Version 0.1.

Wrote this for fun and educational purposes because of a mailing list post:
http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/couchdb-user/200911.mbox/%3C15b2d9090911231348u69a40deu37583520334f2317@mail.gmail.com%3E

It takes a common log formatted web server log and turns it into a bulk insert
command for CouchDB. Nothing will make sense if you feed it a web server log
that isn't in the common log format unless you're really lucky.

Dependencies
------------

* couchdb >= 0.9.x
* sed
* readline support
* sh

How to Use It
-------------

The package accepts common log formatted web server logs via stdin, and then
outputs the resulting bulk insert to stdout. The output isn't very human
friendly, because I assume you'll be sending it out over the wire and don't
want to waste time on white space.

Most basic usage example (everything ends up in your console):
./common2couchdb.sh < /var/log/apache2/access.log

Second most basic usage example (everything ends up in ./a.out):
./common2couchdb.sh < /var/log/apache2/access.log > ./a.out

The Document
------------

Each log entry gets put into this format (note: all values are strings):

{
  "host": "",       //hostname or IP
  "user": "",       //the user doing the requesting
  "identifier": "", //the user's identifier
  "timestamp": "",  //format: dd/MMM/yyyy/:hh/:mm/:ss/ +-hhmm
  "request": "",    //the HTTP request line
  "httpStatus": "", //valid HTTP status code
  "bytes": ""       //size of response in bytes
}

Note, most web servers will output a "-" if a piece of information is missing
(ex., user) or inappropriate. We don't check to see if a value is filled, we
just pass through what's in the log. 

There is currently no way to add fields on the command line, so you'll have to
edit the source for now (ex., adding an _id).

Wishlist
--------
 * Allow the user to specify an _id value on the command line.
 * Allow the user to specify a min, or start, date. This will prevent creating
   duplicates, unnecessary reading of the whole log file, etc.
